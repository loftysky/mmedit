- Determine what types of footage we might have, and how it is arranged:
    - Something DJI, looks like DCIM/100MEDIA/DJI_0126.MP4
    - Blackmagic something:
        CAM1-URSA/Blackmagic URSA_1_2016-04-08_1453_C0000.mov
    - Sony A7 via recorder (prores 4:2:2):
        A7S/A7S-CARD2/SHOGUN_S003_S001_T002.MOV
    - Sony older something something:
        *.MTS
    - Sony XDCam
        XDROOT/Clip/DEC.4-ANNA0540.MXF
        XDROOT/Clip/DEC.4-ANNA0540M01.XML
        XDROOT/Clip/DEC.4-ANNA0540R01.BIM
    - arbitrary files:
        *.mov
        *.mp4
        *.jp[e]g (??)
        *.mxf
        *.avi

- Determine if we can use symlinks in our re-organized tree, or if we
  have to use hardlinks or simply rename everything.
  - What software needs to deal with the raw files, and can it deal with symlinks
    âˆš Adobe Premiere (seems ok for: source import, EDL export).
    x Adobe After Effects (resolves symlinks on import).
    - Avid Media Composer?
    - Foundry Nuke Studio?
    - Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve?
    - Blackmagic Fusion?


Overall plan
------------
- CLI: `mmedit-ingest-footage [--name NAME] [--yes] /path/to/directory`
- GUI: Uses the same functions that the CLI does, but is gooey.
